# Predicting Profits

## Objective
In this report I predicted profit as a target feature from multivariate features.
I used Python Programming version 3 and Jupyter Notebook to write and run code.

There are five features and fifty observations in the dataset.
All of them are numerical categories.

    - R&D Spend: research and develpment spending refers to the costs of research and development
    - Administration: refers to the costs of administration
    - Marketing Spend: refers to the costs of marketing processes
    - State: refers to name of State
    - Profit: refers to total of profits in United State Dollars $

## Used Algorithm
I used linear regression algorithm with back-word elimination technique to optimize model with the actual features.
